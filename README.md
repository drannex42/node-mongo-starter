## History
 
I created this about five years ago based off of sahat/hackathon-starter after a dozen times of replacing useless* files and functions. This is a bare metal repo for platform developments that has created hundreds of projects and supported over a million users. There is no styling included, and very minimal pages except for the bare requirements. 
 
This very simple repo includes a fully crafted authentication suite using passport, with account management features. 
 
We use the [Nunjucks by Mozilla](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) (better than Jade/Pug) templating engine that is a port based on Jinga2.

This repo will be rarely updated as it is incredibly minimal and easy to understand. This has very little opinions built in and is a quick start to developing platforms of your own. 

Enjoy.
